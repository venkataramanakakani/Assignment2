Cyclomatic Complexity:
Cyclomatic Complexity is defined as the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. CC is also defined as the number of test cases to be covered.
CC is calculated with formula E-N+2(P) where
E= the number of edges of the graph
N=the number of nodes of the graph
P= the number of connected components (exit nodes)

From our CFG we can calculate CC as:
E=12; N=10; P=1
Cyclomatic Complexity = 12-10+2(1) = 2+2 = 4
We can write 4 Test cases for the present program for good coverage.
